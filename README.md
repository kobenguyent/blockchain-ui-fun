React application that allows you to interact with a blockchain. You can see the blocks on chain, see transaction within them and even create new transactions and mine blocks.

Built on top of [KobeCoin](https://github.com/kobenguyent/blockchain-fun) (Blockchain implementation in Typescript).

---

## Live demo
**[Check it out here.](https://kobenguyent.github.io/blockchain-ui-fun/)** You can create transactions, mine blocks and explore your own blockchain.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Get a copy of the KobeCoin front-end running on your local machine (for playing around, testing or development).

```
git clone https://github.com/kobenguyent/blockchain-ui-fun.git
```

Install the dependencies:
```
cd blockchain-ui-fun
npm i
```

Run the application:
```
npm run dev
```

At this point the application should be running on your machine, for instance on [http://127.0.0.1:5173/blockchain-ui-fun/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/blockchain-ui-fun/)

**Creating new transactions:** You can create new transactions to any wallet for any amount (no validation). New transactions will be added to the "pending transactions", ready to be included in the next block.
